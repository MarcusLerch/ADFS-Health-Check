# ADFS-Health-Check
Script to check some basic services, events and the certificates on ADFS Servers

This script collects information from one or more ADFS servers and rates the health of the farm based on this information.
Included is a check of the basic web urls of the ADFS farm.
It also checks the certificates on the ADFS Website and tries to detect if the ADFS server is in certificate rollover phase.
